<h2>The closing words</h2>
<p>
When I grow up, I may not recognize it as my first project.<br>
I am more greedy than I look.<br> I want to look intelligent and cheerful,
and I want to earn a lot of money.<br> Later on, I may hide this serious work because I feel ashamed,<br>
but I actually wish she would smile at me and identify me as a successful person later.</p>
<p>I'll create another projects by studying which one will make a great result.<br>
  Also, someday I want to open this project and works that I will made.<br>
  I hope many people will get interested in my projects.<br>
  Lastly, thank you for visiting my homepage and thanks for reading my stories.<br>
