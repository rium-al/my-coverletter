<h2>Small stories</h2>
<p>I actually thought deeply about coding this year
  because I thought it was cool to see my favorite YouTuber doing coding.<br>
  At that time, I thought that I wanted to do coding as my dream.<br>
  I thought that I wanted to be that cool person, too</p>
  <p>Since I was little, my dream has been to become a fashion designer.<br>
   It's amazing that it suddenly changed to another dream this year.<br>
   I hope having this dream can be a good breakthrough.</p>
<p>I want to learn coding quickly and succeed, but I think I will need a lot of time as a beginner.<br>
I will give up my greed and learn step by step.<br>
In the real world, my grades are not bad, my paintings are not bad, I speak pretty well,<br>
but I don't think I'm particularly good at anything.<br></p>
<p>I don't know if it's because of my personal greed,
but this has always been my personal weakness.<br>
The other students seemed to have already set their own paths and tried,
so they were getting smaller.<br> But I think that's why I became more interested in coding.
Now I have a way forward.<br> The process of learning now is not difficult, it's fun.</p>
