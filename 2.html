<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This homepage is my first work by doing coding.<br>
  It has only one image and lots of sentences about myself and this project.<br>
 It is something that is not very touching or funny stories.<br>
  The reason for this is I want to make a meaningful work as my first work.<br>
  But I'll make more things without serious works like this one.<br></p>

  <p><img src="image.jpg" width="450px"></p>
  <p>This project was not made by difficult codes, because I just started learning coding.<br>
    I'm empty robot that can't do anything and can learn everything.<br>
    Like a robot in the picture on the top of this paragraph.<br>
  And also there is no long explanation or meaning in this homepage.<br>
  So it can look like a homepage created by a 7-8-year-old child, and it shames me.<br>
  But it's my first work, so I have no choice but to use simple codes.<br>
  Also I planned to make a very very very simple homepage.<br>
  I hope you understand this messages and read other chapters</p>
